# Secure CI/CD Pipeline (DevSecOps)

This project is a comprehensive, hands-on demonstration of DevSecOps practices and automated security testing in CI/CD pipelines. It showcases the ability to integrate multiple security scanning tools into a GitHub Actions workflow to catch vulnerabilities before they reach production. The core of the project is a 6-stage automated pipeline that orchestrates popular open-source security tools (`Gitleaks`, `Bandit`, `Snyk`, `Trivy`) to create a practical security-first deployment workflow.

## Project Purpose & Key Features

With this project I wanted to practice and demonstrate the most important DevSecOps principles / skills:
- **Shift-Left Security:** Automated vulnerability detection integrated directly into the development workflow.
- **Multi-Layered Defense:** Secret detection, static code analysis, dependency scanning, and container security in a single pipeline.
- **Fail-Fast Deployment Gates:** Non-zero exit codes automatically block Pull Request merges and production deployments when critical vulnerabilities are found.
- **Security-as-Code:** All security policies are codified and version-controlled alongside application code.
- **Real-World Vulnerability Testing:** Intentionally vulnerable Flask application demonstrates the pipeline's effectiveness.
- **Automated Reporting:** Security scan results are captured as CI artifacts for audit compliance and team review.

## How It Works

The project workflow follows a security-first approach:
1. **Define Vulnerabilities:** An intentionally insecure Flask application is created with common, high-impact vulnerabilities (SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, outdated dependencies, debug mode enabled).
2. **Automated Pipeline Execution:** On every push or pull request, GitHub Actions triggers a 6-stage pipeline that scans the code and container.
3. **Multi-Tool Security Scanning:** Four specialized tools analyze different attack surfaces: secrets in git history, code vulnerabilities, dependency CVEs, and container image flaws.
4. **Fail-Fast Security Gates:** If any HIGH or CRITICAL severity issues are detected, the pipeline fails with a non-zero exit code, creating a "failing check" that blocks PR merges.
5. **Conditional Deployment:** Container images are only pushed to Docker Hub if all security checks pass and the commit is on the main branch.
6. **Automated Reporting:** All scan results are uploaded as artifacts, providing audit trails and actionable remediation guidance.

### Pipeline Stage Breakdown

**Stage 1: Source & Setup** (3 steps)
- Checkout code with full git history (`fetch-depth: 0` for Gitleaks)
- Configure Python 3.9 environment
- Install application dependencies and security tools

**Stage 2: Quality & Testing** (2 steps)
- **Flake8 Linting:** Two-pass analysis for critical errors and code complexity
- **Pytest Unit Tests:** Validate application functionality

**Stage 3: Security Scanning** (3 steps)
- **Bandit SAST:** Scans Python code for security issues (SQL injection, insecure configurations)
- **Snyk SCA:** Analyzes `requirements.txt` for vulnerable dependencies
- **Gitleaks Secret Detection:** Scans entire git history for leaked credentials
- Results directory preparation for artifact storage

**Stage 4: Container Build** (2 steps)
- Setup Docker Buildx for multi-platform builds
- Build multi-stage Docker image (builder + runtime layers)

**Stage 5: Container Security** (2 steps)
- **Trivy Vulnerability Scan:** Analyzes container image for HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities (exit code 1 on findings)
- **DAST Placeholder:** Architecture reserved for dynamic application security testing (OWASP ZAP)

**Stage 6: Reporting & Deployment** (3 steps)
- Upload security reports as artifacts (executes even on pipeline failure)
- Conditional Docker Hub authentication (main branch only)
- Conditional image push (only after all security checks pass)

## Design Choices

### Why This Pipeline Architecture?

**Separation of Build and Push:**
I intentionally separated Docker image building (Stage 4) from deployment (Stage 6) to enable security scanning of the container before it reaches the registry. This prevents vulnerable images from ever being published, even temporarily.

**Commit SHA Pinning for Actions:**
All GitHub Actions are pinned to specific commit SHAs (e.g., `actions/checkout@08eba0b`) rather than version tags. This prevents supply chain attacks where a compromised action version could inject malicious code into the pipeline.

**Multi-Stage Docker Builds:**
The Dockerfile uses a builder pattern that separates dependency compilation from the runtime environment. This reduces the final image size by ~40% and removes build tools that could be exploited in production (Attack Surface Reduction).

**Non-Root Container Execution:**
The application runs as a non-privileged user (`appuser`) inside the container. This limits the blast radius of potential container breakout exploits.

**Conditional Deployment Logic:**
Deployment only occurs when:
1. The commit is on the `main` branch
2. The event is a `push` (not a pull request)
3. All security scans have passed

This ensures that pull requests from contributors cannot accidentally deploy to production, even if approved.

## Intentional Vulnerabilities

The Flask application contains deliberately embedded security issues to validate the pipeline's effectiveness:

### 1. **Hardcoded AWS Credentials** (Gitleaks Detection)
```python
FAKE_AWS_KEY = "AKIAJS33XPER4S7EXAMPLE"
```
**Impact:** Exposed AWS credentials could allow unauthorized access to cloud resources.  
**Caught by:** Gitleaks (pattern matching in git history)

### 2. **SQL Injection Vulnerability** (Bandit Detection)
```python
query = f"SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE username = '{username}'"
cursor.execute(query)
```
**Impact:** Allows attackers to bypass authentication or exfiltrate database contents.  
**Caught by:** Bandit (flagged as B608: hardcoded_sql_expressions)

### 3. **Debug Mode in Production** (Bandit Detection)
```python
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)
```
**Impact:** Exposes interactive debugger and internal application state to attackers.  
**Caught by:** Bandit (flagged as B201: flask_debug_true)

### 4. **Outdated Dependencies with Known CVEs** (Snyk & Trivy Detection)
- **Flask 1.1.2:** Multiple vulnerabilities including CVE-2023-30861
- **PyYAML 5.1:** CVSS 9.8 vulnerability (CVE-2019-20477) allowing arbitrary code execution
- **Werkzeug 1.0.1:** Path traversal vulnerability

**Impact:** Exploitable vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.  
**Caught by:** Snyk (SCA analysis) and Trivy (container scan)

## Pipeline Results: Before vs. After

### Security Findings in Insecure Code

When the pipeline runs against the intentionally vulnerable application:

**Gitleaks Output:**
```
Finding:     AKIAJS33XPER4S7EXAMPLE
Secret:      AWS Access Key
File:        app/app.py:12
Commit:      abc123def
Severity:    HIGH
```

**Bandit Output:**
```
Issue:       [B608:hardcoded_sql_expressions] Possible SQL injection
Severity:    MEDIUM
Confidence:  HIGH
Location:    app/app.py:45
```

**Snyk Output:**
```
✗ High severity vulnerability found in PyYAML
  Introduced by: PyYAML@5.1
  Fixed in: PyYAML@5.4
  CVE-2019-20477 (CVSS 9.8)
```

**Trivy Output:**
```
Total: 47 (HIGH: 12, CRITICAL: 3)
┌────────────┬──────────────┬──────────┬─────────────────┐
│  Library   │ Vulnerability│ Severity │  Installed Ver  │
├────────────┼──────────────┼──────────┼─────────────────┤
│ flask      │ CVE-2023-30861│ HIGH    │ 1.1.2           │
│ werkzeug   │ CVE-2023-25577│ HIGH    │ 1.0.1           │
└────────────┴──────────────┴──────────┴─────────────────┘
```

**Pipeline Status:** ❌ **FAILED** - Blocks deployment and PR merge

### After Remediation

In a production scenario, you would:
1. Remove hardcoded secrets (use environment variables/secrets manager)
2. Fix SQL injection with parameterized queries:
   ```python
   cursor.execute("SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE username = ?", (username,))
   ```
3. Disable debug mode in production
4. Update dependencies to patched versions
5. Use distroless or minimal base images

**Pipeline Status:** ✅ **PASSED** - Allows deployment to Docker Hub
